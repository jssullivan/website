        "When I am not programming I am usually outside, whether it is in the woods or in the sea. When in the woods, I usually go on multi-day backpacing trips. Of the National Parks my favorites are Grand Teton in Wyoming, Zion in Utah and Olympic in Washington. I am also a PADI Advanced Open Water SCUBA Diver and have enjoyed diving in Key Largo, FL and Rockport, MA."
