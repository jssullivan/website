        "I am a Software Engineer currently living in San Fransisco, California, originally from Boston, Massachusetts. My development focus has been on Full-Stack Web Development, with the goal of creating awesome new products. I have used ReactJS and AngularJS on the Front-End and NodeJS and Java on the Back-End. Currently I am at Vinolytics, a Wine Management Startup, as a Full-Stack Contract Developer.",
        "When I am not programming, I am usually outside in the woods or the sea. When in the woods, I usually go on multi-day backpacing trips, but I have recently started ice climbing. Of the National Parks in the United States, my favorites are Grand Teton in Wyoming, Zion in Utah and Olympic in Washington. I am also a PADI Advanced Open Water SCUBA Diver and have enjoyed diving in Key Largo, FL and Rockport, MA."
